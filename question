why does the filter and delete part of this code not work when I launch it in vs code it just says python stuff, meanwhile the code before it actually asks stuff and imput it and displays questions and number def expense(): expense_list = { "food": [], "housing": [], "clothing": [], "transportation": [], "entertainment": [], "saving": [], } # user input while True: category = input("Which expense category: ") if category not in expense_list: print("enter a category") continue items = input("What is your item: ") price = float(input("How much does it cost: ")) expense_list[category].append({ "item": items, "price": price }) add = input("add more category:yes/no:") if add in ("n", "no"): break elif add in ("y", "yes"): continue else: print("enter y or n") return expense_list expenses = expense() for category, items in expenses.items(): print(f"\n{category}:") for x in items: print(f"{x['item']}: {x['price']}") def remove_expense(expense_list): print("\n Remove Expense ") category = input("give category to delete!:") if category in expense_list: item_name = input("give item to delete!:") found = False current_items = expense_list[category] # Look through list for i in range(len(current_items) - 1, -1, -1): if current_items[i]["item"] == item_name: expense_list[category].pop(i) print(f"Deleted {item_name}.") found = True break if not found: print("Item not found.") else: print("Category does not exist.") return expense_list def filter_expenses(expense_list): print("\n Filter by Category") category = input("give category to view!:") if category in expense_list: items = expense_list[category] if len(items) > 0: print(f"\nExpenses for {category}:") for x in items: print(f"- {x['item']}: ${x['price']}") else: print("No expenses in this category!") else: print("Not even a Category!")
